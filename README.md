## Assessment

### Background

An engineer on our team started work on a Decision Engine to approve/decline credit card applicants. However, they have
been unable to complete the project. Your task is to help complete the project, and improve the overall code quality as
you see fit.

---

### Requirements

Your task is to add rules as specified
and have the engine return "approved" or "declined" for the data provided. The engine should be able to be triggered by
a POST request and must handle errors gracefully.

1. Implement a `POST` HTTP endpoint that:

   * Receives [a request with JSON body](#request-body).
   
   * Runs through the [Decision Engine Rules](#decision-rules).
   
   * Returns [a response with JSON body](#response-body):
   
     * status = `approved` if all rules are passed.
     
     * status = `declined` if any rules are failed.
     
3. Handle errors gracefully, without stopping the process and server.
